Once you have a draft, don’t forget to tweak it to add your unique voice and style.<br><br><br><br>### Create Snapshots for Social Sharing<br><br><br><br>If you’re creating video content, consider generating short snippets or quotes from your script that can be turned into eye-catching graphics for Instagram or TikTok.
